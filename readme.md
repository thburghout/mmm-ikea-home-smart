# Ikea Home Smart - Magic Mirror Module

This is a module for the [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/).

Uses the npm package [ikea-tradfri](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ikea-tradfri) 
to provide some rudimentary actions.

## Installation

```Shell
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
git clone https://github.com/thburghout/mmm-ikea-home-smart.git
cd mmm-ikea-home-smart
npm install
```

Next, you are going to have to obtain the credentials to control the devices 
through the Tradfri gateway. 
These can be obtained via the `setup.js` script.

1. Make sure that your gateway has a **static ip address** configured in your router.
   * Please see your router's manual on how to do that.
     The gateway can be recognized by its name starting with `GW-`.
2. Obtain the gateway's identity by scanning the QR code on the bottom of the gateway. 
   It contains a string containing the MAC address and the identity separated by a comma. 
   **You only need the identity**.
3. Run the setup script using `node setup.js`.
4. Provide the address and identity when prompted.
5. Add the given configuration parameters to `config.js` as shown below.
